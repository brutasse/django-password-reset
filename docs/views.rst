Views
=====

.. note::

    The ``Recover`` and ``Reset`` views share a common attribute, ``salt``.
    This is the `salt used for signing the password reset link`_, it is useful
    for avoiding collisions with values you may have signed elsewhere in your
    app. It doesn't need to be complicated, just distinct from other salts
    you're using in your code. More importantly, the salt must be the same on
    the ``Recover`` and the ``Reset`` views. The default salt is
    ``password_recovery``. If you're not already using this as a salt
    somewhere else in your app, you don't need to alter it.

    Additionally, there is a ``url_salt`` used for redirecting the user after
    he has entered his username or email. This salt **must** be different than
    the other one. Its default value is ``password_recovery_url``.

corresponding user object and sends him an email.

Attributes

* ``case_sensitive``: whether to search case-sensitively based on the form
  data. Default: ``True``.

* ``form_class``: the form to use for validating the user. Default:
  ``password_reset.forms.PasswordRecoveryForm``. To customize form error
  messages, subclass the form and override the ``error_messages`` attribute.

* ``success_url_name``: the name of the URL to redirect to after sending the
  recovery email. Change it if you don't use the provided URLconf. Defaults to
  ``password_reset_sent``.

  email. Default: ``password_reset/recovery_email.txt``.
